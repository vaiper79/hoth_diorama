Change Log

Remaining Items:
- Fine tune the display. 
- Add display text and logo for each voice and its owner
- Stress test, see if I can make it stutter and stop in weird conditions. 

Done/Ignored/Fixed/Created/Removed/Tested (version numbers are internal for now):
Version 18 (November 25th 2018)
Fixed: Nearly a complete rewrite. Ran into multiple issues, memory and space foremost. Then realized several features were added later on and early coded features did not anticipate the recent additions' impact.
Added: Voices. Many quotes from the scene has been added and will play at random intervals, in order of appearance in the movie. 
Added: Rebel logo to scroll screen. Star Wars logo is stored, but remains unused. See remaining items.

Version 17 (November 5th 2018):
Milestone: Diorama done. Any coding to be done is purely for added functionality, see remaining items.
Fixed: Sorted out some missing items in the parts list. The list is still not exhaustive. Drop me a line if there are particulars I should have covered. 
Added: Voices that run once or twice.
Fixed: A bug where scrolling did not begin before some kind of user input.
Fixed: A bug where AT-AT cockpit did not light back up after beig unpaused. 

Version 16 (September 21st 2018)
Milestone: This is the first test with electronics installed in diorama. Done, tested and working with this version: OLED, snowspeeders and internal base lighting.
Fixed: Issue where the laser cannons on the speeders weren’t acting as expected. Issue was two-fold: Crossed wires and some quick’n’dirty coding that just did not do what it was supposed to. 
Removed: Cleaned up some of the variables that weren’t being used
Fixed: Sorted out some of the commenting that had gotten a bit off as changes were being made, especially with the removal of the cockpit lighting in the snowspeeders.

Version 15 (May 5th 2018):
Done: Enable the second audio channel to gain full stereo
Done: Started testing on separate rig if 560 ohm is ok for explosion LED.

Version 14 (April 2nd 2018):
- Removed: Following a test of lights in the Snowspeeder cockpit, these are removed and rather retasked for a second Snowspeeder's cannons. Not tested, and might need more work to be visually usable. 
- Added: Links to most (all?) parts

Version 13 (March 18th 2018):
- Removed: Snowspeeder engine LEDs, retasked for Snowspeeder cockpit lighting attempt
- Fixed: Created variables to control 1) snowspeeder cockpit lighting brightness and 2) HLC brightness	
- Fixed: Cleaned up some code, removed mentions of rotary encoder

Version 12:
- Removed: SPI.h, no need for it
- Tested: 128x64 display, presumably too low on resources for proper operation
- Created: Functions to turn off and on LEDs while paused

Version 11: 
- Added: 128x32 i2c OLED
- Added: Paused indicator to OLED screen
- Added: Volume indicator to OLED screen. Mapped to -5 to -70dB to a _more_ human readable 0 to 65 number volume range.

Version 10: 
- Created: Non-audio mode, just the light

Version 9:
- Fixed: Make engine LEDs “flicker”..f-ing impossible..too much silliness happening between SoftPWM and crap..maybe later.. 
- Done: Consider removing the rotary encoder..just another physical hole in case now that the remote works
- Ignored: Try to fix the delay/millis issue with the volume setting
- Fixed: Make the volume setting never go above a certain limit to avoide clipping the speakers

Version 8:
- Fixed: Incorporate new Amp

Version 7:
- Fixed: At one point the ATAT HLC1 fires and seems to hang, after which we sometimes get glitches where the ATAT fires audio but not the LED. Pseudo random means it happens at the same time, every time..
- Fixed: If available pins, add LEDs for lasers on Speeder, use odd even function to fire every other side :) 
    - Even: if ( (i % 2) == 0) { do_something(); }
    - Odd: if ( (i & 0x01) == 0) { do_something(); }
    - or alt Odd: if (i % 2) { // do something odd; } 
- Fixed: Explode more often
- Fixed: Randomize explosions
- Fixed: Randomize Speeder sounds. 

Unknown and Prior Version: 
- Fixed: Used SoftPWM fade in and out to circumvent the need to create a fade in and out function for the explosions.. :-) 
- Fixed: Timer issue between SoftPWM and IRRemote..gah!
