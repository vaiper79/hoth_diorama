Change Log

Remaining Items:
- Possibly create other versions of the HLC fire and Speeder blaster sounds for dynamic-ism
- Consider a functionality where one can switch off elements.. Like isolate the ATAT or just the snow speeders.
- Music mode..i.e. dialogue from the scene in the movie on top of the sounds, possibly turns he volume of the action down to hear the voice  of Luke.. See if I can get voice of Luke without other sounds..hmm..

Done/Ignored/Fixed (version numbers are internal for now):
Version 13:
- Removed Snowspeeder engine LEDs, retasked for Snowspeeder cockpit lighting attempt
- Created variables to control 1) snowspeeder cockpit lighting brightness adn 2) HLC brightness
- Cleaned up some code, removed mentions of rotary encoder

Version 12:
- Removed SPI.h, no need for it
- Tried 128x64 display, presumably too low on resources for proper operation
- Made functions to turn off and on LEDs while paused

Version 11: 
- Added: 128x32 i2c OLED
- Added: Paused indicator to OLED screen
- Added: Volume indicator to OLED screen. Mapped to -5 to -70dB to a _more_ human readable 0 to 65 number volume range.

Version 10: 
- Created: Non-audio mode, just the light

Version 9:
- Fixed: Make engine LEDs “flicker”..f-ing impossible..too much silliness happening between SoftPWM and crap..maybe later.. 
- Done: Consider removing the rotary encoder..just another physical hole in case now that the remote works
- Ignored: Try to fix the delay/millis issue with the volume setting
- Fixed: Make the volume setting never go above a certain limit to avoide clipping the speakers

Version 8:
- Fixed: Incorporate new Amp

Version 7:
- Fixed: At one point the ATAT HLC1 fires and seems to hang, after which we sometimes get glitches where the ATAT fires audio but not the LED. Pseudo random means it happens at the same time, every time..
- Fixed: If available pins, add LEDs for lasers on Speeder, use odd even function to fire every other side :) 
    - Even: if ( (i % 2) == 0) { do_something(); }
    - Odd: if ( (i & 0x01) == 0) { do_something(); }
    - or alt Odd: if (i % 2) { // do something odd; } 
- Fixed: Explode more often
- Fixed: Randomize explosions
- Fixed: Randomize Speeder sounds. 

Unknown and Prior Version: 
- Fixed: Used SoftPWM fade in and out to circumvent the need to create a fade in and out function for the explosions.. :-) 
- Fixed: Timer issue between SoftPWM and IRRemote..gah!
